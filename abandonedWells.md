  <p>A well that is not in use-or sometimes referred to as an "abandoned" well - can be a potential threat to health, safety and the environment. Wells that are no longer used may be buried or forgotten. Often, they have not been sealed properly. Sealing is the process of clearing an unused well of debris and filling the well with a special material called grout. Owners may seal their own well; however, the Commission strongly recommends that the sealing be done by a licensed well contractor. Unused wells that have not been properly sealed can be a source of ground water contamination, potentially affecting nearby drinking water wells. As a well ages, the casing may rust, joints may leak, the pump may become stuck in the well, or the well may fill with debris. If the well is covered with loose boards or concrete, the cover may eventually decay or break open. Surface water runoff, debris and other contaminants can then enter the well.,</p>

  <h2>WHAT DOES THE LAW REQUIRE?</h2>

  <p>By law, open holes, mine shafts, wells, pits, and other hazards must be protected to prevent persons or property from injury. Water wells deemed to be abandoned must be plugged. Abandoned Water Well means a well whose use has been permanently discontinued. Any well shall be deemed abandoned which is in such a state of disrepair that continued use for the purpose of obtaining ground water is impractical.</p>

  <h2>HOW ARE WELLS SEALED?</h2>

  <p> Don't try to do it yourself. You may be liable for the cost of removing any sealing materials you may have used. A licensed well contractor will have the necessary equipment and expertise to seal your well properly. The contractor can also handle all the necessary paperwork. To find a contractor, look in the Yellow Pages under Well Drilling and Service. The Arkansas Water Well Construction Commission also has a list of licensed contractors. Before sealing the well, the contractor will remove any pumping equipment that may still be in place and remove any debris or other obstructions from the well. The well is then sealed by pumping a grout mixture into the well. When the job is done, the contractor will submit a record to the AWWCC. You will also get a copy of the well sealing record from the licensed well contractor. Keep it in a safe place. It provides proof that the well has been properly sealed, and no longer poses a hazard. The job is completed when:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The physical hazard is eliminated.</li>
    <li>Ground water contamination is prevented.</li>
    <li>Yield conservation and the hydrostatic head of the aquifer is maintained.</li>
    <li>Intermingling of desirable and undesirable water is prevented.</li>
  </ul>
