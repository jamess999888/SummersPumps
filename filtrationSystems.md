                Impression Series Air Sulfur (IMS) and Air Iron (IMB) Filters are extremely effective in removing hydrogen sulfide and iron, commonly associated with problem well water. These innovative designs use a unique air-injection filtering technology to oxidize sulfur or iron into precipitates that can be readily filtered and removed. Impression Series Air Charge Filters are environmentally safe – no toxic chemicals are used like in other systems. The result is simply refreshingly good water from the tap, every time.

                Amazingly compact nuvoH2O water softeners provide naturally conditioned water without the hassle of salt. The nuvoH2O water softeners use a process called chelation to soften the water. The nuvoH2O chelant, a proprietary citrus formulation, binds with hard water minerals so they cannot react with other elements to produce scale. Unlike salt-based softeners, nuvoH2O not only prevents hard water build-up, but it also removes existing scale. nuvoH20 – A better way to soften water.
